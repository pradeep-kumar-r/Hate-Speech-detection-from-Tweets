Hate Speech detection from Tweets

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. The data used is a pre-curated set of tweets annotated with a "hate speech" label. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. 

Here, we try to predict if a tweet has racist/sexist content through different algorithms ranging from simple binary classifiers to more sophisticated techniques.

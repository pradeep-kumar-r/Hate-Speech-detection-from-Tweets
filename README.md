Hate Speech detection from Tweets

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. The data used is a pre-curated set of tweets annotated with a "hate speech" label that was part of a practice hackathon on Analytics Vidhya. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. 

Here, we try to predict if a tweet has racist/sexist content through different algorithms ranging from simple binary classifiers to more sophisticated techniques.

The focus is not on the model performance, rather to show how to process free flowing text into machine-readable forms and how to apply different ML algorithms to solve the problem at hand
